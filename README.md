# GTM Server - Variable template - IP Address Truncate

## ðŸš€ How It Works
- Download the .tpl file.
- Import it into the Templates section of your Server-side GTM container.
- Create a new variable using the imported template :
  - Select the desired IPV4 truncation level.
  - IP source field :
    - Leave empty to use the default ip_override (at least sent with GA4 events).
    - Or, select the variable that contains your custom IP address.

âœ… That's it â€” you're all set !
